# Unhandled Promise Rejection: TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '...') in React Native

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native where you try to access a state variable before it has been fully initialized.  The error usually manifests as an `Unhandled Promise Rejection: TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '...')` and is often related to asynchronous operations.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Run the app using your preferred React Native method (e.g., `npx react-native run-android` or `npx react-native run-ios`).
4. Observe the error in your console.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring the state is initialized and checking for `undefined` before accessing its properties.  The `BugSolution.js` file demonstrates this.
